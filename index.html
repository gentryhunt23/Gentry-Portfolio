            <p id="about-me">
                I am a former collegiate athlete and recent graduate with a BS in Biological Sciences. I have completed numerous jobs surrounding sales and leadership while balancing the pressures of scholastics and athletics. I have spent the majority of my university life travelling the country to play sports and teach basketball skill sets to zealous youth. In between seasons I found time to search for career paths and work in retail and sales environments. During my time as a student I was heavily involved with extracurricular organizations outside of sport i.e. GVSU Black Student Union and Man Cave while aiding in the development of "Prgrssn". 
            </p>
                <p>I also take pride in the development of significant and proficient interpersonal skills including networking and written and verbal communication. I have recently decided to switch career paths to become the best software developer this nation has seen. I am currently adding multimedia manipulation skills to my bag of tricks in order to create my next big move. I intend on using every single skill that I have gathered to create a mobile application that could be as big as Instagram. God Willing. Mamba Mentality. I'll see you at the top.
